<p style="font-size: 14px;">Hello, I am, well was, Spaceman. The designer of milk, pancake, and a few other boards. I am sorry to say this but I am leaving. I can&rsquo;t remain in this hobby any longer as it has worn on me too much. I am so happy to have met each of you and you have made an impact on my life but it is time for me to move on. As for my boards, anything that is not a commission or currently being sold by MKU will be open-sourced under the 40% group on GitHub and the repositories under Spaceman will be cleared. As for Pancake v2, I will continue to see that it is completed and shipped through MKU but I will not be in the 40% Discord to promote it. I am sorry that it has come to this and I hope you can forgive me for how sudden this all is.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">As always my DMs will be open feel free to message me with any concerns or questions. @Spaceman#5064 is my username.</p>
